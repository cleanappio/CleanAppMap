# CleanAppMap

// notes

OpenStreetMap Overlay:

To create an OpenStreetMap overlay called "CleanAppMap," 

1. create an account on OpenStreetMap.org
2. Click on the "Export" tab in the top menu.
3. Use the map view and search tools to locate the area that you want to include in your overlay.
4. Adjust the zoom level and map view as needed to include the entire area that you want to include in your overlay.
5. Click on the "Export" button in the top-right corner of the map view.
6. In the "Export" dialog box, choose the "Custom Extent" option and make sure that the current map view is selected.
7. In the "Format" dropdown menu, choose the "GeoJSON" option.
8. In the "Name" field, enter "CleanAppMap" as the name for your overlay.
9. Click on the "Export" button to download the GeoJSON file for your overlay.
10. Once you have downloaded the GeoJSON file, you can use it to create a custom map layer in your iOS app. To do this, you would need to use a library like Mapbox or OpenMapTiles to parse and display the GeoJSON data on top of an OpenStreetMap base map. You can then use the custom map layer to display the locations of litter reported by your app's users.
